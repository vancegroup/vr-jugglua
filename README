VR JuggLua
----------

Lua bindings and high-level interface for virtual experience creation, built on VR Juggler

Dependencies:
-------------
 - CMake 2.6 or newer (tested mainly with 2.8.3) - build system generator
 - Boost 1.35 or newer
 - VR Juggler 2.2.x (2.2.2 or newer recommended), or VR Juggler 3.0.x, built against the same Boost above.
 - OpenSceneGraph, including osgIntrospection/wrappers (2.8.x tested)
 - For GUI console support, highly recommended, at least one of the following:
   - Qt version 4.5 (?) or newer - best choice
   - FLTK 1.1.10

LuaBind, osgLua, and Lua 5.1.4 are included in the source tree and integrated
in to the build - you do not need to build these separately.
