osgLua
------
   osgLua is a lua wrapper that explores in run-time OpenSceneGraph's classes
   and methods using the osgIntrospection capabilities. osgLua can also be 
   used to access your own reflected classes (with osgWrapper), everything
   accessible through osgIntrospection can be created, used, passed or
   returned by the lua script.


How to use osgLua
-----------------

   osgLua uses the same directory structure as other OSG projects, simply use
   make to compile libraries and examples. Remember that you can use:
       make INST_LOCATION=/whatever/is/osg/path install 
   in order to install osgLua in the same directory as OpenSceneGraph. 

   You will need osg libs and lua5.1 to compile osgLua. In run-time osgLua
   will require osgWrappers dll/so's to look into osg's classes, types, and 
   methods.

   In the `scripts' directory of each example you will find some examples of 
   scripts written in lua. `osgconsle/scrips/test.lua' shows a complete example
   of how to setup a viewer from the script, since osgProducer is reflected by
   osg introspection it can be instanced and used from the lua script.
   Nevertheless, osgLua's initial purpose was scene creation with a procedural
   language.

Scripts notes
-------------
    
   To create an instance of an object or get a value from an enumeration 
   you can write:
   
       v = osg.Vec2(5,6)
       value = osgProducer.Viewer.ViewerOptions.STANDARD_SETTINGS
   
   as a general rule when we use "::" in C++ to access a namespace in lua 
   is replaced by "."  (eg. osg::Vec2 --> osg.Vec2)

   You can also use a the function `createByName' to instance objects:

      v = createByName("osg::Vec2",5,6)
   
   Once the we have an instance we can call methods using ":" :

      v = osg.Vec2(5,6)
      v:set(7,8)
      v:normalize()
      print(v:x(), v:y())
   
   (This is the pseudo-object-oriented style of use objects in lua sorry about
    the notation, what is a "." in C++ is a ":" in Lua)
   
   Some objects have "properties", which may be accessed using "." :
      mat = osg.Matrix.scale(osg.Vec3d(2, 2, 2))
      print(mat.Scale)
      
      mat.Trans = osg.Vec3d(4, 4, 4)
      print(mat.Trans)

   Finally there are several more functions accessible from luaScripts:
      osgLua.loadObjectFile(filename) -> returns the osg object contained in
            filename
      osgLua.saveObjectFile(object, filename) -> saves some osg object into
            filename
      osgLua.getTypes() -> returns a table with all reflected types by
                osgIntrospection
      osgLua.getTypeInfo(type) -> type can be an instance or a string with the name
                    of a class. Returns a dictionary with keys: name, methods,
                    constructors, ...  with information about the class ( see
                    scripts/show.lua )
